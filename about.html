                <h2>DJ, producer and label head of south London’s Church, Seb Wildblood is currently exploring the deeper side of electronic
                music.</h2>
                <p style="bio-text">
                     Back in the early 2010’s, when we were just getting our heads around the concept of going to clubs and dancing to loud music,
                    Church at Corsica Studios were there to put a gentle arm around our shoulders, ushering us into the safe haven of house music.
                    One half of said outfit, now also a very on point label, is Seb Wildblood. Taking a few years to get things right with Church,
                    he’s recently stepped out to push his own productions of warm, hazy, downtempo house, with releases on MadTech, Skint and
                    Church. For his debut album, he’s gone the DIY route, releasing on the newly-formed catalogue number SW. A few tracks have
                    started to surface and we’re dead impressed[...]  </p>

                <h3>The South London Church boss' new label project will be a "new avenue of sounds untapped."</h3>
                <p>
                    South London's Seb Wildbood is one busy guy. Not only does he run the city's much loved Church label—releasing his own sax-fueled
                    productions as well as smooth smears of house from the likes of Mall Grab—but he also recently launched the Coastal Haze
                    imprint alongside Hollick (who also co-runs No Bad Days). Where do these lads find the time? In fact, they probably have
                    little to no free time at all because they're constantly finding new ways to feature the best in brightest in contemporary
                    dance music across wax, tapes, and radio. Case in point: Wildbloods new label project, All My Thoughts, which is kicking
                    off with a splendid EP from Australia's DJ Heure.
